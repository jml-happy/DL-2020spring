## Presentation Objective
Learn to understand and analyze findings in a deep learning paper.

## Guidelines
1. Read "[reading_a_cs_research_paper.pdf](https://github.com/badriadhikari/badriadhikari.github.io/blob/master/resources/reading_a_cs_research_paper.pdf)" and "[how_to_read_a_paper.pdf](https://github.com/badriadhikari/badriadhikari.github.io/blob/master/resources/how_to_read_a_paper.pdf)".
2. Form a random group of 3 students
3. Select a paper of your choice
   - NIPS 2019 - [Poster](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?type=Poster) or [Oral](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?type=Oral)
   - ECCV 2019 - [papers](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/ICCV2019.py)
   - CVPR 2019 - [papers](http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/program/main_conference)
4. Prepare slides to present your understanding/analysis of the paper.
5. You will have maximum 4 minutes to present.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Finishing your presentation within 10 minutes.

1. What is the research problem the paper attempts to address?  
What is the motivation of the research work? Is there a crisis in the research field that the paper attempts to resolve? Is the research work attempting to overcome the weaknesses of existing approaches? Is an existing research paradigm challenged? In short, what is the niche of the paper?

1. What are the claimed contributions of the paper?  
What is new in this paper? A new question is asked? A new understanding of the research problem? A new methodology for solving problems? A new algorithm? A new breed of software tools or systems? A new experimental method? A new proof technique? A new formalism or notation? A new evidence to substantiate or disprove a previously published claim? A new research area? In short, what is innovative about this paper?

1. How do the authors substantiate their claims?  
What is the methodology adopted to substantiate the claims? What is the argument of the paper? What are the major theorems? What experiments are conducted? Data analyses? Simulations? Benchmarks? User studies? Case studies? Examples? In short, what makes the claims scientific (as opposed to being mere opinions1)?

1. What are the conclusions?  
What have we learned from the paper? Shall the standard practice of the field be changed as a result of the new findings? Is the result generalizable? Can the result be applied to other areas of the field? What are the open problems? In short, what are the lessons one can learn from the paper?
