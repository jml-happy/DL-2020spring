## Presentation Objective
Learn to understand and analyze findings in a deep learning paper (NIPS papers).

## Guidelines
1. Read "reading_a_cs_research_paper.pdf" and "how_to_read_a_paper.pdf" in this folder.
2. Select a recent NIPS paper of your choice

5. You will have maximum 4 minutes to present.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. [1 point] Finishing your presentation between 3 and 4 minutes.

1. [1 point] What is the research problem the paper attempts to address?  
What is the motivation of the research work? Is there a crisis in the research field that the paper attempts to resolve? Is the research work attempting to overcome the weaknesses of existing approaches? Is an existing research paradigm challenged? In short, what is the niche of the paper?

1. [1 point] What are the claimed contributions of the paper?  
What is new in this paper? A new question is asked? A new understanding of the research problem? A new methodology for solving problems? A new algorithm? A new breed of software tools or systems? A new experimental method? A new proof technique? A new formalism or notation? A new evidence to substantiate or disprove a previously published claim? A new research area? In short, what is innovative about this paper?

1. [1 point] How do the authors substantiate their claims?  
What is the methodology adopted to substantiate the claims? What is the argument of the paper? What are the major theorems? What experiments are conducted? Data analyses? Simulations? Benchmarks?
