## Densely connected Neural Networks vs Convolutional neural networks  

- Coca-cola ad - Hulk vs Antman (size corresponds to the number of parameters/connections)

#### A convolutional neuron does what a lifeguard does at a pool
- He scans the poolâ€™s surface creating an output map (that is exactly what convolution does)
  - One lifeguard looking who knows the relationship between light reflections and drowning
  - Another lifeguard who knows the relationship between the body size and drowning
  - Another lifeguard who knows the relationship between the water splashing and drowning
